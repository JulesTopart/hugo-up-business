# Hugo Up Business

Up Business is a clean and modern landing page, inspired on light illustrations
with a modern look, that can be used for companies or to showcase a product.

## Live Demo

See [here](https://hugo-up-business.netlify.app/).

## Quick Start

If you are creating a new website, the quickest way to get up and running is to
clone the theme  and use the basic example as an starting point:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/writeonlycode/hugo-up-business.git
cp -rf hugo-up-business/hugoBasicExample/ my-new-site/
cd my-new-site/
npm install
hugo server
```

The folder `hugoBasicExample` contains a working version of a website with the
theme. It includes: the configuration files, the content folder `content` and
the `data` folder. It's a good idea to copy this over to the project folder to
get an initial version of the website up and running.

Now `npm install` will install the NPM dependencies, and `hugo server` will
start the local development server with a working version of the website with
the theme.
